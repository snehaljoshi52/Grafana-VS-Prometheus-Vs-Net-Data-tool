Grafana
--------
        > What It Is: A visualization and dashboard tool.

        > Purpose: It’s used to create and display interactive charts, graphs, and dashboards from various data sources.

        > How It Works: Grafana itself doesn’t collect data; instead, it connects to databases and other data sources (like Prometheus) to visualize the data.

        > Best For: Users who need to create custom dashboards and detailed visualizations from different data sources.


Prometheus
-----------
           > What It Is: A monitoring and alerting system.

           > Purpose: It collects and stores metrics data, such as system performance metrics, and allows querying of this data.

           > How It Works: Prometheus collects data via a pull model (regularly fetching data from configured endpoints) and stores it in a time-series database. It also supports alerting based on the metrics it collects.
        
           > Best For: Users who need to monitor system metrics and set up alerts based on specific conditions.


Netdata
--------
         > What It Is: A real-time monitoring tool.

         > Purpose: It provides real-time insights and visualizations of system performance and health.

         > How It Works: Netdata collects a wide range of metrics from your system and services, displays them on an interactive web dashboard, and can alert you to issues.

         > Best For: Users who need a comprehensive, out-of-the-box solution for real-time monitoring with minimal setup.


Summary
-------
      Grafana: Primarily for visualizing data from various sources, but doesn’t collect data itself.

      Prometheus: Collects and stores metrics, provides querying and alerting capabilities, often used as a data source for Grafana.

      Netdata: Provides real-time monitoring and visualization with built-in data collection and alerting features.
